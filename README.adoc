= Neo4j Simple Client

== Why this project ?

* Simple and small Neo4j client
* A Singleton for the Neo4j Driver (as needed)
* A simple and single configuration file
* A stupid object mapping
* Transparent for single or cluster architecture

== Installation


== Configuration

All the configuration comes from one file : **neo4j-driver.properties**
This should be at the root of the classpath.

[source,properties]
----
neo4j.url=bolt://localhost
neo4j.user=neo4j
neo4j.password=admin
----

NOTE: To make this configuration dynamic, you can use some maven filters

IMPORTANT: You can override those properties, with a second files named : **neo4j-driver-ext.properties** . This file must be also at the root of the classpath, like into the **shared/classes/** folder of a tomcat server.

== How to use it ?

Just call it like this for a read query

[source,java]
----
import org.neo4j.driver.*
import static org.neo4j.driver.v1.Values.parameters;
...
Neo4jClient.read("MATCH (n:Person { name:$name, born:$born }) RETURN n", parameters( "name", "Keanu Reeves", "born", 1964 ));
----

And for a write query :

[source,java]
----
Neo4jClient.write("CREATE (n:Person { name:$name, born:$born }) RETURN n", parameters( "name", "Keanu Reeves", "born", 1964 ))
----
